Staking Rewards strengthen the network by incentivizing honest nodes. Each additional coin staked makes the network more invulnerable to attacks.

Staking Rewards also fuels eCash’s economic engine, allowing XEC holders to earn passive income, incentivizing holding, and supporting the price by reducing available supply.

### Do I need to upgrade my wallet?
The network upgrade only affects full nodes. Other eCash software, including wallets such as eCash wallet are not affected by the network upgrade.

### How to stake eCash?
With eCash staking, users lock-in or “stake” XEC on the blockchain to earn validator privileges to help secure the network, earning rewards in the process.

2. Pooled staking

Like staking as a service, pooled staking assigns the operations of a validator node to a third-party service provider, which can be done with a small amount of XEC.

3. Staking as a Service

Staking as a service refers to third-party service providers that run and maintain validator nodes on your behalf.

**XEC is not an ERC-20 token, it is its own blockchain similar to Bitcoin (BTC).**
